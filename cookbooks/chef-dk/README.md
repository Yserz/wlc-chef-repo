A cookbook for installing the Chef Development Kit.

Requirements
============

As of version 0.3.5, Chef-DK packages are available for RHEL/CentOS/etc. 6,
Ubuntu 12.04/13.10, Debian 6/7, OS X 10.8/10.9/10.10, and Windows 7/8/2008/2012.
Each of these platforms is supported by this cookbook.

In some cases, platforms that aren't officially supported by Chef-DK may still
function. For example, this cookbook could be used to install the Ubuntu package
onto a 14.04 system. YMMV.

Prior to Chef 11.12.0, the core did not offer the `windows_package` resource
that is used for installation under Windows. _This cookbook will not run on
Windows under earlier versions of Chef._

This cookbook consumes the
[dmg cookbook](http://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/dmg) in order to
support OS X installs. That cookbook's limitations, such as the inability
to upgrade or uninstall packages, are thus present in the OS X implementation
here.

Package download information is obtained from Chef's
[Omnitruck API](https://github.com/opscode/opscode-omnitruck) using the
[Omnijack Gem](https://github.com/RoboticCheese/omnijack-ruby) that is
installed at runtime.

Usage
=====

This cookbook can be implemented either by calling its resource directly, or
adding the recipe that wraps it to your run\_list.

Recipes
=======

***default***

Calls the `chef_dk` resource to do a package install.

Attributes
==========

***default***

Attributes are provided to allow overriding of the package version or URL the
default recipe installs:

    default['chef_dk']['version'] = 'latest'
    default['chef_dk']['package_url'] = nil
    default['chef_dk']['global_shell_init'] = false

Resources
=========

***chef_dk***

Wraps the fetching of the package file from S3 and the package installation
into a single resource:

Syntax:

    chef_dk 'my_chef_dk' do
        version '1.2.3-4'
        global_shell_init true
        action :install
    end

Actions:

| Action     | Description                   |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| `:install` | Default; installs the Chef-DK |
| `:remove`  | Uninstalls the Chef-DK        |

Attributes:

| Attribute           | Default    | Description                               |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `version`           | `'latest'` | Install a specific version\*              |
| `prerelease`        | `false`    | Enable installation of prerelease builds  |
| `nightlies`         | `false`    | Enable installation of nightly builds     |
| `package_url`       | `nil`      | DL from a specific URL\*                  |
| `global_shell_init` | `false`    | Set ChefDK as the global default Ruby\*\* |

_\* A `version` and `package_url` cannot be used together_

_\*\* The global Ruby env is set by a bashrc, so not compatible with Windows_

Providers
=========

This cookbook includes a provider for each of its supported platform families.
By default, the `chef_dk` resource will determine a provider to used based on
the platform on which Chef is running.

***Chef::Provider::ChefDk***

A generic provider of all non-platform-specific functionality.

***Chef::Provider::ChefDk::Debian***

Provides the Ubuntu platform support.

***Chef::Provider::ChefDk::MacOsX***

Provides the Mac OS X platform support.

***Chef::Provider::ChefDk::Rhel***

Provides the RHEL and RHELalike platform support.

***Chef::Provider::ChefDk::Windows***

Provides the Windows platform support.
