  "long_description": "vagrant Cookbook\n================\n\nInstalls Vagrant 1.1+ and manages vagrant plugins w/ a custom\nresource.\n\n* Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/\n\nThis cookbook is not intended to be used for vagrant \"1.0\" (gem\ninstall) versions. A recipe is provided for removing the gem, see __Recipes__.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nTested on Chef 11:\n\n* Debian 6\n* CentOS 6.3\n\nMay work on other Debian/RHEL family distributions with or without\nmodification.\n\nSupport exists for Windows and OS X but this has not yet been tested.\n\nThe URL and Checksum attributes must be set, see __Attributes__\n\nBecause Vagrant is installed as a native system package, Chef must run\nas a privileged user (e.g., root).\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nThe following attributes *must* be set.\n\n* `node['vagrant']['url']` - URL to the Vagrant installation package.\n* `node['vagrant']['checksum']` - SHA256 checksum of the Vagrant\n  installation package.\n\nIf the node is Windows, the MSI version must be set. This is used by\nthe `windows_package` resource to determine if the package is\ninstalled.\n\n* `node['vagrant']['msi_version']` - Version string of the installed\n  MSI \"package\" on Windows.\n\nThe following attribute is optional.\n\n* `node['vagrant']['plugins']` - An array of plugins. The elements in\n  the array can be a string or a hash. String elements should be the\n  names of plugins to install. Hash elements should have two keys,\n  \"name\" and \"version\", for the plugin name and its version to\n  install. This is used by the `vagrant_plugin` resource in the\n  default recipe.\n\nResources\n=========\n\nThis cookbook includes the `vagrant_plugin` resource, for managing\nvagrant plugins.\n\n## vagrant_plugin\n\n### Actions\n\n- `:install`: installs the specified plugin. Default.\n- `:uninstall`: uninstalls the specified plugin\n- `:remove`: uninstalls the specified plugin\n\n### Attribute Parameters\n\n- `:plugin_name`: name attribute, the name of the plugin, e.g.\n  \"vagrant-omnibus\".\n- `:version`: version of the plugin to installed, must be specified as\n  a string, e.g., \"1.0.2\"\n\n### Examples\n\n    vagrant_plugin \"vagrant-omnibus\"\n\n    vagrant_plugin \"vagrant-berkshelf\"\n      version \"1.2.0\"\n    end\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\n## default\n\nThe default recipe includes the platform-family specific recipe to\ninstall Vagrant. It then iterates over the\n`node['vagrant']['plugins']` attribute to install any required vagrant\nplugins.\n\n## debian, fedora, mac_os_x, rhel, windows\n\nThese are the platform family recipes included by the default recipe.\nThe `fedora` recipe will include `rhel`.\n\n## uninstall_gem\n\nThis recipe will attempt to uninstall the `vagrant` gem with the\n`gem_package` and `chef_gem` resources. Meaning, it will use the `gem`\nbinary in the `PATH` of the shell executing Chef to uninstall, and\nthen use Chef's built-in RubyGems to uninstall. If you have a\ncustomized Ruby environment, such as with rbenv or rvm (or other), you\nmay need to manually remove and clean up anything leftover, such as\nrunning `rbenv rehash`. Likewise, if you have multiple copies of the\nvagrant gem installed, you'll need to clean up all versions. This\nrecipe won't support such craziness :-).\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSet the url and checksum attributes on the node. Do this in a role, or\na \"wrapper\" cookbook.\n\nThen include the default recipe on the node's run list.\n\nTo specify plugins for installation in the default recipe, specify an\narray for the `node['vagrant']['plugins']` attribute. For example, to\ninstall the `vagrant-omnibus` plugin (any version) and version \"1.2.0\"\nof the `vagrant-berkshelf` plugin:\n\n    node.set['vagrant']['plugins'] = [\n      \"vagrant-omnibus\",\n      {\"name\" => \"vagrant-berkshelf\", \"version\" => \"1.2.0\"}\n    ]\n\nSee the attribute description above.\n\nLicense and Authors\n-------------------\n\n* Author:: Joshua Timberman <opensource@housepub.org>\n* Copyright (c) 2013, Joshua Timberman\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
